#Replicating Experiments:
You can replicate the hyperparameter tuning experiment using the validationaccuracy.ipynb notebook, along with the TrainingEncoded.csv, ValidationEncoded.csv, and TestingEncoded.csv datasets.
The raw output log of this experiment can be found in HPTuningNotes1.txt

You can replicate the dropout experiment using the DropoutTesting.ipynb notebook with the same datasets as before. 

The graphs are generated using visualiser.py and dropout_visualiser.py respectively
